# Osint

The goal of the project is to create a tool capable of quickly recovering all the
information linked to a domain name (for example its creation/expiration date, its
availability, etc.), then display them in a more readable and faster format.

## List of information to retrieve

* who owns the domain name
* its registrar and administrative information
* its date of creation
* its expiration date
* DNS information(s)
* his certificate

## How to start application

``` python3 -m flask run  ```

* after that you can access the page with your localhost adress
